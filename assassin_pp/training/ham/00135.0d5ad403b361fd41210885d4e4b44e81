ok, so i was also learning about css this weekend (thanks to the fine
folks in irc.linux.ie, #linux!).  i came up with the following in
my travels.  first, two style sheets:

http://ie.suberic.net/css/style.css:
    body {
	color : black;
	background-color : white;
    }

http://ie.suberic.net/css/style-windows.css:
    body {
	background-image : url("http://ie.suberic.net/images/use.linux.gif");
	background-repeat: repeat;
    }

then i include the css in an html page like so:
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
    <html>
    <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
    <title>blah</title>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-15">
    </head>

now i use mod_rewrite to rewrite requests for /css/style.css to
/css/style-windows.css if the browser is on windows by putting this
in httpd.conf:

    RewriteEngine   on
    #RewriteLog     "/tmp/foo.log"  # use this for debugging
    #RewriteLogLevel        3
    RewriteCond     %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}      Windows
    RewriteRule     ^/css/style\.css$       /css/style-windows.css

oh, and of course images/use.linux.gif is an animated gif that is
transparent for 55 seconds and then displays "use linux!" in a large
blue font for 5 seconds.  :)

and the way to create animated gifs is to put each frame in a layer in
the gimp.  pick any name for each layer, but make sure each layer ends
with (XXXms) where XXX is the number of milliseconds the frame displays.
then use the animation tool to export the animation.
