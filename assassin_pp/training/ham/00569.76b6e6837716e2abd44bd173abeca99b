I use a perl script that disables Razor for thirty minutes any time it =
times out.  Not a true fix, but a workaround.

  Subject: [Razor-users] Reliability of the razor servers?


  ok so after waiting all this time before upgrading to V2 (just did it =
this morning because V1 isn't effective at all anymore) i ran into =
problems with reliability of the servers. it took me about half an hour =
to do a razor-admin -create and razor-admin -register constantly =
retrying because it kept timing out

  connect1: nextserver: Could not get valid info from Discovery Servers

  is it a problem just now or is that standard issue? up until now i've =
been advocating razor to all, but i it starts to have reliability issues =
we might as well look for another way to catch the spam, we can't afford =
to have one anti spam trick, no matter how effective, bog down the =
entire mail server
