I actually thought of this kind of active chat at AOL (in 1996 I think), 
bringing up ads based on what was being discussed and other features. 
For a while, the VP of dev. (now still CTO I think) was really hot on 
the idea and they discussed patenting it. Then they lost interest. 
Probably a good thing.
